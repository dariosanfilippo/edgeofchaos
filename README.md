# Edge of Chaos

This repository contains libraries including some essential building blocks for the implementation of musical complex adaptive systems in the Faust programming environment. (https://faust.grame.fr.)

It includes a set of time-domain algorithms, some of which are original, for the processing of low-level and high-level information as well as the processing of sound using standard and non-conventional techniques. It also includes functions for realisation of networks with different topologies, linear and nonlinear mapping strategies to render positive and negative feedback relationships, and different kinds of energy-preserving techniques for the stability of self-oscillating systems.

Edge of Chaos is being developed and maintained by Dario Sanfilippo and it is the library through which he creates his music. (http://dariosanfilippo.tumblr.com - sanfilippo.dario at gmail dot com.)
