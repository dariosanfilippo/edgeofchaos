# Edge of Chaos

This repository contains libraries including some essential building blocks for the implementation of musical complex adaptive systems in the Faust programming environment. (https://faust.grame.fr.)

It includes a set of algorithms, some of which are original, for the time-domain processing of audio, information and mapping to create autonomous and self-regulating systems for live music performance.

Edge of Chaos is being developed and maintained by Dario Sanfilippo and it is the library through which he creates his music. (http://dariosanfilippo.tumblr.com - sanfilippo.dario at gmail dot com.)
